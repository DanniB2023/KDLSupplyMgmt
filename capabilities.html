        <h3>Why KDL Services Supply Management is Important</h3>
        <p>KDL Services Supply Management is crucial for any organization because doing it well 
            can introduce several benefits to your organization. From freight, to packaging, to fulfillment, 
            to small parcel services, KDL Services is driven to reimagine the entire supply chain. We provide 
            a seamless experience for retailers with our proprietary systems and business intelligence. 
        </p>
        <p>Finished goods are no longer 100 percent made by brand names. Now, parts and materials are sourced from 
            outside vendors who provide them across a global supply chain. According to an infographic from the 
            National Institute of Standards and Technologyâ€™s Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership, 230,000 
            small manufacturers contribute to US supply chains and 42 percent of all US manufacturing workers are 
            employed by small manufacturers. This creates a ever-growing, complex web of materials providers, 
            suppliers, distributors, logistics companies and manufacturers. Supply chain management must evolve 
            accordingly in order to keep up with increasing complexity, risk, and variables in global demand or 
            suppliers.<br><br> In retail product industries, supply chains focus more on logistics and 
            transportation. Higher volumes of finished goods going to more customers creates different challenges 
            regarding fulfillment, shortages, transportation costs, and more. Retail supply chains often have 
            multiple warehouses and a complicated web of transportation processes.</p>
